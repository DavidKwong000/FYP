# FYP
This group project is gonna to make a system to help those baby helper to take care their baby easily.

The system include three parts which are server part on raspberry pi, sensors part linked to the raspberry pi and the mobile application part. We use sone sensors (like distance sensor, flame sensor, rain sensor, temperature sensor and so on) to detect the baby movment and the user's home situation. After that it will report the situation to the server and the server will do some respon to the helper and the user.

I mainly focus on the server part and the communication part between server and the senor. The FYP_server_final.py file is the server part of the system. On the process of creating the server, I combine other teammate's code and my code to one coding style. Also adding some other feature into the server.
